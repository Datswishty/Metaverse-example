## Intro
Hi stranger, this repo is an example of a metaverse game smart contract, this repo exists because we didn't get paid for our job , so enjoy!Â 

This decision didn't come easy,Â  we've discussed it with other members of the best team I worked with!

CTO âˆ’ https://github.com/sudo-xu

FRONT-END âˆ’ https://github.com/lita-alita

SOLIDITY âˆ’ https://github.com/Bubble7777

SOLIDITY2 - me ofc ðŸ˜†

## Tech Specs
To avoid contract size and upgradeability limitations, the main architecture employs EIP-2535 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).
We've experimented with EIP-998 and EIP-4400 to build the most advanced experience for usersÂ 

All tests are valid, so if you have code questions, go there (even if the quality isn't the best; I tried but deadlines xD).)

If you have any questions related to code âˆ’ feel free to open an issue!Â
