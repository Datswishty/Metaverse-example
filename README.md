## Tech Specs
Main archtiechture uses EIP-2535(https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) to not be limited to contract size and upgradability
We've experemented with EIP-998 and EIP-4400 to build the most advanced experience for users 
All tests are valid , so if you have questions about code - it's better to go there ( Even though the quality not the best , I've tried but deadlines xD)

If you have any questions related to code - feel free to open an issue!
